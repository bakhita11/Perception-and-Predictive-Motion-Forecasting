# Perception-and-Predictive-Motion-Forecasting
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of Cross-Modal Adaptive Attention (CMAA), , a unified end-to-end architecture for multimodal autonomous driving perception and motion forecasting. MAA dynamically fuses camera, LiDAR, and RADAR inputs using learnable modality gating and bidirectional cross-modal attention.
